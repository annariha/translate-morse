# translate-morse

As part of my work as a student assistant, I created a decoder-encoder LSTM for decoding morsecode in R with the R-packages `keras` and `tensorflow` by adjusting an example for a sequence-to-sequence LSTM that can be found here: https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/lstm_seq2seq.html
