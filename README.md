# translate-morse

Work-in-progess: As part of my work as a student assistant, I created a decoder-encoder LSTM for decoding morsecode in R with the R-packages `keras` and `tensorflow` by adjusting an example for a sequence-to-sequence LSTM that can be found here: https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/lstm_seq2seq.html

In `Morsedecoder_Keras.Rmd`, the process is presented and explained in more detail. 

The data with sentence pairs in English and French is available here: http://www.manythings.org/anki/fra-eng.zip 
For the presented example, only the English sentences were used.
